The DCNN model used in this study is a machine learning classifier,
meaning results vary from run to run. Thus, results will not be 
entirely replicable compared to those published in the accompanying
manuscript. 

Moreover, the code associated with the original study that this 
manuscript is based off of (Coffer et al., 2020, Rem. Sens. Environ.)
used IDL programming while the supplemental material included with 
this manuscript used open-source Python programming in an effort to 
increase accessibility. Therefore, differences also exist due to 
the different computer programs used.
